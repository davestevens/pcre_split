pcreSplit
dave stevens (@daveisanidiot)

implementation of perl split() command in C using pcre

perl split - http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/split.html
pcre - http://www.pcre.org/

compile with:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -lpcre src/main.c src/pcre_split.c -Iinc -o pcreSplitTest

in src/main.c there is a main function which will run the split command with a couple of examples


####
Mac - download and install pcre from the link above
Ubuntu - I had issues with libraries not being found when installing from source. Use 'apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev' to install.
